        This is my little Raspberry Pi rack. Currently, it just has 2 Pis, but I hope to get another Pi 4 soon. A couple months ago, these guys were collecting dust, so I decided to do something about it. I was running all my services on a VPS or a Unraid machine, but I nothing warranted using either of those things, so I decided to go back to Raspberry Pis. Right now, I have Homeassistant running in a docker container on one, and on the other, I have an instance of Pi Hole and this very website hosted on it. When I get a Pi 4, I'd like to turn it into a Nextcloud box of some sort since I'm just using Google Drive currently. Maybe I'll host Bitwarden on it too. Not sure yet. Hopefully I come up with some other ideas as this thing has got me interested in the world of selfhosting. The enclosure for the Raspberry Pis is 3D printed off of thingiverse and can be found here. The OLED screen mounts can be found here. I just used an example script from Adafruit to show system vitals on both of them.
